"""Background memory/skill review — fork the agent to evaluate the turn.

After every turn, ``AIAgent.run_conversation`` may call
:func:`spawn_background_review` to fire off a daemon thread that replays
the conversation snapshot in a forked :class:`AIAgent` and asks itself
"should any skill/memory be saved or updated?".  Writes go straight to
the memory + skill stores.  Main conversation and prompt cache are never
touched.

The fork inherits the parent's live runtime (provider, model, base_url,
credentials, cached system prompt) so it hits the same prefix cache and
uses the same auth.  It runs with a tool whitelist limited to memory and
skill management tools; everything else is denied at runtime.

See the ``hermes-agent-dev`` skill (``references/self-improvement-loop.md``)
for invariants and PR review criteria.
